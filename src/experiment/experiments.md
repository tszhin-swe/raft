Network: Simulated latency (RTT) injection via a wrapper around the RPC delivery or explicitly inside the labrpc network configuration.Time: Use virtual/simulated time if possible, or standard time.Sleep with deterministic seeds for reproducibility.Experiment 1: Leader Election Tradeoff (Split Vote Analysis)Objective: Compare standard randomized timeouts vs. narrow timeouts to demonstrate the safety/availability tradeoff.Variables:Cluster Size: 5 nodes.Condition A (Standard): Election Timeout = 150ms + rand(0-150ms).Condition B (Too Narrow): Election Timeout = 150ms + rand(0-10ms).Procedure:Start cluster, wait for initial leader.Loop 50 times:Disconnect/Crash current leader.Start timer.Wait until a new stable leader is detected (term increases + heartbeat received).Stop timer.Metric 1: Record ElectionDuration.Metric 2: detect SplitVote (if Term increments > 1 time before leader established).Restore crashed node, rejoin, repeat.Experiment 2: Throughput & Latency vs. Quorum SizeObjective: Quantify the latency penalty of larger quorums and network RTT.Variables:Cluster Configs: (3 nodes, 5ms RTT) vs (5 nodes, 5ms RTT) vs (5 nodes, 15ms RTT).Workload:Clients: 25 concurrent goroutines.Requests: 1000 Start(command) calls per client (Total 25,000 ops).Procedure:Set fixed network RTT delay (simulated sleep in RPC handler).Start timer (TestStart).Launch client goroutines.For each successful Start() that returns isLeader=true, record timestamp.When applyCh receives the commit, record timestamp.Metric 1: CommitLatency (Apply Time - Start Time). Calculate Median.Metric 2: Throughput (Total Ops / Total Test Duration).Experiment 3: Log Catch-Up OptimizationObjective: Measure recovery speed of the conflictTerm/conflictIndex optimization vs. naive backtracking.Variables:Optimization: Toggle boolean Raft.enableConflictOpt (True/False).Lag Size: 500 entries.Procedure:Start 5-node cluster.Isolate Follower S5 (disconnect from network).Submit 500 log entries to Leader (S1) $\rightarrow$ replicated to S1-S4.Reconnect S5.Start timer.Count distinct AppendEntries RPCs sent to S5.Poll S5 until S5.lastApplied == 500.Stop timer.Metric 1: RecoveryTime (ms).Metric 2: RPCCount (Total round trips to sync).
